    <h2>Description</h2>


    <p>The absolute classic recipe for crisp and fluffy Yorkshire puddings.</p>


    <p>The secret to getting gloriously puffed-up Yorkshire puddings is to have the fat sizzling hot and don't open the oven door!</p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>


    <ul>
        <li>140g plain flour</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>200ml milk</li>
        <li>sunflower oil</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>


    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 230C/fan 210C/gas 8.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a little sunflower oil evenly into two 4-hole Yorkshire pudding tins or two 12-hole non-stick muffin tins and place in the oven to heat through.</li>
        <li>To make the batter, tip 140g plain flour into a bowl and beat in 4 eggs until smooth.</li>
        <li>Gradually add 200ml milk and carry on beating until the mix is completely lump-free. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into a jug, then remove the hot tins from the oven. Carefully and evenly pour the batter into the holes.</li>
        <li>Place the tins back in the oven and leave undisturbed for 20-25 mins until the puddings have puffed up and browned.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately. <em>You can now cool them and freeze for up to 1 month</em>.</li>
    </ol>
